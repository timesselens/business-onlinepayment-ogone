=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module interfaces Business::OnlinePayment with L<Ogone|http://www.ogone.com>, a European Payment Provider.
It is based on the Ogone L<DirectLink API|http://www.ogone.com/en/Solutions/Payment%20Processing/DirectLink.aspx>.

Ogone accepted credit cards: American Express, MasterCard, VISA, AIRPLUS, Aurore, Billy, Cofinoga, Diners Club, JCB,
Laser, PrivilÃ¨ge, Solo, MaestroUK, UATP

=head2 Features

=over 4

=item * code is documented and hopefully quite readable

=item * prevents submitting your transaction twice

=item * accepts EUR and US currencies (defaults to Euro)

=item * allows creation of VISA Alias mitigating the need to store them temporary (RES -> SAL)

=item * allows creation of Recurrent VISA bills (Subscriptions)

=item * close coupling to native API, easy to crossreference

=item * allows Ogone's native operations: RES, REN, DEL, DES, SAL, SAS, RFD, RFS

=item * uses SHASign to protect your request's integrity

=item * implements SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512 signing

=item * allows switching between test and production environments

=item * low-fat is_success() check, Ogone::Status has more details

=item * no dependency on Ogone::Status if memory is a constraint

=head1 PROGRAM FLOW

You have a choice when implementing credit card processing. You can pocess the money transfer in one or more steps.
If you choose to go with one step, customers will be billed directly.

=over 4

=item B<action> => 'Normal Authorization' (with B<operation> => 'SAL' (default))

=item B<action> => 'Authorization Only' (with B<operation> => 'RES' (default)) then B<action> => 'Post Authorization' (with B<operation> => 'SAS' (default))

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new()

Not used directly. Creates a new instance. It's possible to pass credential infomation in the constructor.

    my $tx = new Business::OnlinePayment('Ogone', pspid => 'fred', login => 'bedrock_api', password => 'fl1nst0ne');

=head2 content()

This method takes a lot of parameters to prepare the transaction to be submitted. Depending on these parameters the
payment processor will act on them in different ways, you can consider it a sort of dispatch table. The main actors are
C<action>, C<alias>, C<win3ds>.

=head3 content() required parameters

Depending on what action you are triggering a number of parameters are required. You can use the following pseudo perl
code as a reference to what exactly is required depending on the parameters.

    my @args_basic  = qw/login password PSPID action/;
    my @args_ccard  = qw/card_number expiration cvc/;
    my @args_alias  = qw/alias cvc/;
    my @args_recur  = (@args_basic, qw/name subscription_id subscription_orderid invoice_number amount currency startdate enddate period_unit period_moment period_number/, has_cc_number() ? @args_ccard : @args_alias ),

    my @args_post   = @args_basic, qw/invoice_number/;
    my @query       = @args_basic, qw/invoice_number/;

    for ($action) {
        qr/authorization only/i      => required_arguments( @args_new ),
        qr/normal authorization/i    => required_arguments( @args_new ),
        qr/post authorization/i      => required_arguments( @args_post ),

=head2 content() examples

=head3 example B<authorization only> request: requests a claim on an amount of money [RES] (and creates an alias)

    my %auth = ( pspid => 'fred', login => 'bedrock_api', password => 'fl1nst0ne' );

    my $id = $session->get('orderid');
    my $res = new Business::OnlinePayment('Ogone', %auth);

    $res->content( invoice_number => $id, action => 'authorization only', alias => 'wilma flinstone',  ... );
    $res->submit();

    if ( $res->is_success() ) {
        $dbh->do('insert into tx_status_log (id,status) values (?,?)',undef,$id,"RES OK");
    };

=head3 example B<post authorization> request: transfers an amount of money [SAL].

    my $sal = new Business::OnlinePayment('Ogone', %auth);

    $sal->content( invoice_number => $is, action => 'post authorization', ...);
    $res->submit();

    if ( $res->is_success() ) {
        $dbh->do('insert into tx_status_log (id,status) values (?,?)',undef,$id,"SAL OK");
    };

=head3 example with B<alias> (ie: no card number used)

    my $res = new Business::OnlinePayment('Ogone',%auth);

    $res->content(alias => 'wilma_flinstone', cvc => 123, ...);
    $res->submit();

    if ( $res->is_success() ) {

=head1 TESTING

To test this module you will need to set your credentials in the environment. Put the following in a file in your hoe directory e.g. F<~/.ogone>
The password is not the same as the PSPID password, you will need to enter the API users' password.

    export OGONE_PSPID=bob
    export OGONE_USERID=bob_api
    export OGONE_PSWD=foobar
    
Limit access to the F<~/.ogone> file

    chmod 600 ~/.ogone

Then load this file into your env en perform the testcases:

    source ~/.ogone
    perl -I lib/ t/*.t

=head2 Bugs, inacuracies and quircks

=head3 Security risk: B<password encryption> 

Ogone claims to encrypt your password where in fact in only hashes it using the SHA-1
algorithm. I suppose someone else wrote the accompanying texts, because the url states hash_pwsd.  

Ofcourse hashing your password is a good thing. An intruder can only steal the hashed password and use it for the
specified service until the password is changed and the hash becomes invalid. The advantage is the intruder could never
'read' your real typed in password should you have used it on other services.

But Ogone has made the hashing straight without a salt, which is a serious issue if you take rainbow tables into
account. Using the rainbow table technique on an unsalted string allows an attacker to reverse engineer the password
rather quickly.

Login into your test environment and goto L<https://secure.ogone.com/ncol/test/hash_pswd.asp> to verify.

    echo -n yourpass | sha1sum

=head3 Refunds: not possible right after transaction.

It takes a while to approve your transaction. You will need to wait for its status to drop from 91 to 9.
If your account type allows it, it's possible to refund by using another transaction. It was however not tested.

=head2 Support Helpdesk

Ogone's support helpdesk will answer promptly within a day, also for test accounts. You will need
to contact them if you would like to add some features like for example 3d-secure. Most of my
helpdesk request have been resolved in matter of days.

=head2 Credentials

You need to create a subaccount to access the API.  Use that subaccount as the USERID or login.
You will need to login with the password of the api user.

If you try to submit requests with a bad username or password your account can get blocked.
To unblock your account you should go into the users panel and reactivate the account.
